 { "name": "Glen Grant 10 Year Old", "abv": "40%", "size": "70cl", "image_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/07/15/glen-grant.jpg", "text": "If you are ever in Rothes, stay at the Station Hotel and walk down the road to the Glen Grant distillery. It is a beautiful spot – roe deer sometimes run in the gardens – but until you get there, try this dram. It is an elegant, typically smooth Speyside, and very easy to drink. The packaging has changed but the stuff inside is as good as ever, fruity and floral and excellent for the money. A drop of water does not hurt it, but if you like adding water to whisky, the 12-year-old is the best for that. Make a note that the soon-to-be released 18 is a magnificent thing, and a bargain at £90." }

{ "name": "Jura Tastival", "abv": "51%", "size": "70cl", "image_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/07/15/jura-tastival.jpg", "text": "Like any hobby, sometimes the story is as important as the product itself. Besides, if you are gifting it, there is something to talk about. The Tastival series is a limited edition run, and this year it is a 51 per cent, triple-sherry finished, non-chill filtered dram. Consequently, it is all maple and raisins, sultanas and hazelnuts – or, to be plain, it is very Christmassy. The youngest whisky in the blend is 14 years old. Elsewhere in the range, the 30-year-old Jura is the best of the bunch by some distance, but you will need to really splash out. " }
